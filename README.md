Next Steps:

The prototype is still inside a bootstrap skin and we may want to strip it out for further tests on raw html5/CSS3 animation. However, for fleshing out of lesson plans, we may want to keep it in, since bootstrap provides easy form input validation states facilitate product development ... please advise ...

I'd like to do some testing with CSS animations and one idea I have it a Counter where you enter 2 numbers as a range and the abacus animates between the lowest and highest numbers, with the numbers also animating like an odometer

Have other ideas too, but this is just the initial project ... let's move product discussions into the wiki ... I will make everyone a contributor ... you just have to create a github account ... Github is a versioning tool and is amazing an amazing way of keeping all the files related to this project in one place.

Let me know what you think.
Maurice
